## Quick history of why Loot Poker

The past few days have been wild in the NFT world with the emergence of Loot.

The Loot Poker idea was born as a way to promote the [Playing Arts Crypto Cards](https://playingarts.com/en/crypto).
PA is an amazing set of 55 nft cards designed by some of the best 3d art creators out there. The PA team is not associated with Loot Poker.

### How it happened.
On Sunday AEP reached out to the Loot Discord if anyone could bounce some ideas around Loot and henry.eth responded. Since then we've talked, tinkered and made Loot Poker.

From here on the community can play, build and earn together.
Thank you for joining the journey. Get on the Discord to stay up to date, give feedback and participate.

## Roadmap

From community chip token drops to giveaways to collaborations.
All is possible. It is being build together on the Discord.
